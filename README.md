### Description

This is a single page web app that uses the PUNK API to receive beers. The beers are shown in the overview page. I fetch 36 beers each time because you cannot fetch all beers in one go. For this sake, I implemented a loadmore button to load in more data. 

You can click on a beer to checkout the detail page for further information; including ingredients and recipes. There are also related beers shown around the same alcohol percentage. When you click on a related beer you will see the detail page of that beer.

## Features

* Loading in data from the PUNK API
* Loading in more data when you click on a button
* Being able to view a detail page
* Being able to view related beers around the same alcohol by volume on the detail page
* Being able to click a related beer to render the new detail page
* Loading...

## API

#### PUNK API

Returns different kinds of beers with a lot of information, some details are:

<details>

* Each IP that makes a request has a rate limit of 3600 requests per hour (1 req/sec)
* No key and authentication needed
* HTTPS

#### Root endpoint

`https://api.punkapi.com/v2/`

There are loads of paramaters which you can add to it, I use:
`per_page`. 

* I use `per_page` to get more items back, because if I don't use this, the amount of items that get returned is limited by 25. 

#### This is how a raw object looks when I fetch it from the API

#### I transformed my data objects to this:
